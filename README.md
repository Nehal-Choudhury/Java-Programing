# Java-Programing
How to Compile and Run a Java Swing Application:

Save: Save the code for each project (e.g., SimpleCalculator.java, TodoListApp.java) into a .java file.

Compile: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and compile it using the Java compiler:

Bash

javac SimpleCalculator.java
(Replace SimpleCalculator.java with the actual file name for other projects.)

Run: After successful compilation, run the application using the Java Virtual Machine:

Bash

java SimpleCalculator
(Again, replace SimpleCalculator with the class name of the project you want to run.)

You can compile and run each Java file independently using the instructions provided previously (save, compile with javac, run with java).
